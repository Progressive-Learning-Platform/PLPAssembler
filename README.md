The Progressive Learning Platform (PLP) is an IDE, assembler and simulator for assembly programming. It was designed as an educational tool and comes with its own assembly language (derived from MIPS) and a full hardware implementation in Verilog. The PLPAssembler assembles programs written in PLP assembly, but is designed to be extended to take in any assembly language.
